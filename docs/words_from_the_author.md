I love writing my own apps, even if they already exists, im hooked on knowing how things work and whats in them.
Im a huge flutter supporter (üíô) and wanted for a while to write a crypto price ticker tile for my `Active Watch 4`.

The development of this library started a couple of months ago and its finally started to take a shape im pleased with.
Working with the [tile api (ProtonLayout)](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/wear/protolayout/package-summary.html) was a pain, its very clunky and takes to many lines to write a simple hello world, it was a very hard accomplishment to work with this api.

For the couple of upcoming versions im planning to address some todos and some of the features listed above by myself.
__But i would very appreciate help in maintaining and fine graining this library (POC for iOS will also be neat)__
I will post some `help wanted` issues once the library will take firmer shape.
